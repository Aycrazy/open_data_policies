The two main identifiers of data, with which users of the open data should converse with 311, are the Case ID and the Type Name field. Type name is the common used title for a service request among city staff, 311, and the community at large. Attribute Descriptions Case ID - Gives a unique identifying number associated with each case.\'a0 Subject - This is the top level hierarchy definition of a service request. It is most closely associated with a department designation.\'a0 Enquiry Type ID - An additional identification number . Reason - This is the 2nd level classification of a service request and reflects a program name or a division assigned to perform the service request.\'a0 Type - This is the 3rd level classification describing what the service request specifically is for. It is the most common designation description used in the city.\'a0 Title - Similar to the Type column, this describes more details about the incident.\'a0 Case Status - If case status = "0", it means the case is closed. If case status = "1", the case is still considered open. All cases with a case status of "1" should not have a closed date. Open Date Time - This is the date and time stamp when the department, program, or division assigned to complete the task in a service request starts working that service request.\'a0 Closed Date Time - The date a resolving department, division or program completed the service request.\'a0 XCoord & YCoord - This is the coordinate the city provides of where the service request occurred in the WGS 84 web Mercator auxilliary sphere coordinate system.

Each sample is collected over a period of 72-hours. The exact dates of collection are not specified on this dataset. Can ID \'96\'a0A unique identifier for this sample and is determined by concatenating the collecting Summa canister\'92s identification number with the month and year of collection. Parameter \'96\'a0The chemical (for this study, all are Volatile Organic Compounds, or VOCs) for which the result is reported. Results \'96\'a0The amount of the particular VOC (parameter) detected in this sample. All results above the detection limit are reported in this dataset. Units \'96\'a0The units in which the result is reported. All results are reported in units of micrograms per cubic meter (\'b5g/m3). CAS \'96\'a0The CAS Registry Number, also referred to as CASRN or CAS Number, is a unique numerical identifier assigned by Chemical Abstracts Service to every chemical substance described in the open scientific literature. HRV \'96\'a0A Health Risk Value (HRV) is the concentration of a chemical that is likely to pose little or no risk to human health and is being used by our study as a reference level for comparing the results. Most HRVs are expressed as concentrations of micrograms of chemical per cubic meter of air (\'b5g/m3). HRVs are developed to protect human health for a specified length of exposure (e.g., one hour, 13 weeks, a lifetime). In cases where an HRV promulgated using the public process described in the Administrative Procedures Act (Minnesota Statutes Chapter 14) was not available as a reference level, we instead used the recommended exposure limit (REL) from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) or the permissible exposure limit (PEL) from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), selecting the most conservative level. For purposes of our study, all reference levels (HRVs, RELs, and PELs) will be referred to as a Health Risk Value. Units -\'a0The units associated with the HRV, REL, or PEL reference level. All reference levels have been converted to units of micrograms per cubic meter (\'b5g/m3). HRV Types \'96\'a0The type (HRV, REL, or PEL) of reference level selected. For the purpose of this study, all are referred to as a Health Risk Value. The value selected was the lowest, most conservative value. Name \'96\'a0The name of the location. Volunteer names and business names are left blank. Description \'96\'a0The type of location where the canister was placed. Volunteer locations are typically residential sites where the property owner/occupant hosts a sampling Summa canister. Business locations, which are also VOC emitters, who are voluntarily participating in the study. \'a0MPCA locations are sites of existing Minnesota Pollution Control Agency air monitors sampling for VOCs where a sampling Summa canister is placed for data comparison. MPRB locations are Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board properties. Sponsored locations are sites where the community has paid for additional sampling Summa canisters to be placed. Address \'96\'a0The address at or near where the sampling Summa canister was placed. City \'96\'a0For mapping purposes, we have included the city where the sampling Summa canister was placed (all are within the Minneapolis boundary). State \'96\'a0For mapping purposes, we have included the state where the sampling Summa canister was placed. Zip \'96\'a0For mapping purposes, we have included the zip code where the sampling Summa canister was placed.\uc0\u8232

Eligible areas were designated in The Minneapolis Plan for Sustainable Growth and consist of Activity Centers, Commercial Nodes, Commercial Corridors, and LRT Station Areas. Exact parcel boundaries of Activity Centers and Commercial Nodes are identified in The Minneapolis Plan. Commercial Corridor areas are generally defined as a one block radius from designated corridors. LRT Station Areas are defined as a \'bd mile radius from each LRT station outside of downtown. Some staff discretion was used in determining precise boundaries for Commercial Corridors and LRT Station Areas in cases where roadways or other natural boundaries made exact definitions unclear. \'a0 Each area is categorized based on a number of metrics used to determine its economic health and opportunity. Varying levels of Great Streets program resources are available, based on this categorization. These categories are defined as: \'a0 Intervene: Areas that are experiencing weak development interest or significant obstacles to attaining the City\'92s commercial development or business investment goals. Support: Areas showing signs of strength, but that remain fragile and have some barriers to market development and business investment. Monitor: Areas with strong market development and business activity. \'a0 For more information, please see the City of Minneapolis Great Streets Program website:\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.ci.minneapolis.mn.us/cped/ba/cped_great_streets_home"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0

The two main identifiers of data, with which users of the open data should converse with 311, are the Case ID and the Type Name field. Type name is the common used title for a service request among city staff, 311, and the community at large. Attribute Descriptions Case ID - Gives a unique identifying number associated with each case.\'a0 Subject - This is the top level hierarchy definition of a service request. It is most closely associated with a department designation.\'a0 Enquiry Type ID - An additional identification number . Reason - This is the 2nd level classification of a service request and reflects a program name or a division assigned to perform the service request.\'a0 Type - This is the 3rd level classification describing what the service request specifically is for. It is the most common designation description used in the city.\'a0 Title - Similar to the Type column, this describes more details about the incident.\'a0 Case Status - If case status = "0", it means the case is closed. If case status = "1", the case is still considered open. All cases with a case status of "1" should not have a closed date. Open Date Time - This is the date and time stamp when the department, program, or division assigned to complete the task in a service request starts working that service request.\'a0 Closed Date Time - The date a resolving department, division or program completed the service request.\'a0 XCoord & YCoord - This is the coordinate the city provides of where the service request occurred in the WGS 84 web Mercator auxilliary sphere coordinate system.

Access to computers and the Internet, along with the skills to use these tools is critical as technology becomes more and more a part of our daily lives and is integrated in our economic, educational, health, and workforce systems. \'a0The results will inform priorities for the City\'92s digital inclusion initiatives, and help engage businesses, neighborhood and community groups, public sector partners, and funders to more effectively address community technology and economic development needs. In addition, the survey provides data to measure changes in the community over time. The City of Minneapolis Information Technology Department contracted with National Research Center, Inc. (NRC) to conduct a survey of residents to inform the City\'92s efforts to overcome the digital equity gap between individuals and groups in their access to and use and knowledge of information and communication technologies. This is the third iteration of the Minneapolis Community Technology Survey; the first was conducted in 2012 and the second in 2013. Summary of Data Fields: Field 1 \'96 Overall percentage of respondents who have lived in Minneapolis for 5 years or less by community and user level Field 2 \'96 Overall percentage of foreign-born respondents by community and user level Field 3 \'96 Overall percentage of respondents who rent their homes by community and user level Field 4 \'96 Overall percentage of respondents who live in attached homes by community and user level Field 5 \'96 Overall percentage of respondents living in households with three or more people by community and user level Field 6 \'96 Overall percentage of respondents living in households with children under the age of 18 by community and user level Field 7 \'96 Overall percentage of female respondents by community and user level Field 8 \'96 Overall percentage of respondents aged 55 years or older by community and user level Field 9 \'96 Overall percentage of respondents who are hispanic and/or any race other than white by community and user level Field 10 \'96 Overall percentage of respondents who prefer to speak a language other than English at home by community and user level Field 11 \'96 Overall percentage of respondents having annual household incomes of less than $50,000 by community and user level Field 12 \'96 Overall percentage of respondents who do not work full- or part-time by community and user level Field 13 \'96 Overall percentage of respondents who do not have a 4-year degree by community and user level\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.minneapolismn.gov/www/groups/public/@bis/documents/webcontent/wcms1p-124476.xlsx"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0

Access to computers and the Internet, along with the skills to use these tools is critical as technology becomes more and more a part of our daily lives and is integrated in our economic, educational, health, and workforce systems. \'a0The results will inform priorities for the City\'92s digital inclusion initiatives, and help engage businesses, neighborhood and community groups, public sector partners, and funders to more effectively address community technology and economic development needs. In addition, the survey provides data to measure changes in the community over time. The City of Minneapolis Information Technology Department contracted with National Research Center, Inc. (NRC) to conduct a survey of residents to inform the City\'92s efforts to overcome the digital equity gap between individuals and groups in their access to and use and knowledge of information and communication technologies. This is the third iteration of the Minneapolis Community Technology Survey; the first was conducted in 2012 and the second in 2013.

The two main identifiers of data, with which users of the open data should converse with 311, are the Case ID and the Type Name field. Type name is the common used title for a service request among city staff, 311, and the community at large. Attribute Descriptions Case ID - Gives a unique identifying number associated with each case.\'a0 Subject - This is the top level hierarchy definition of a service request. It is most closely associated with a department designation.\'a0 Enquiry Type ID - An additional identification number . Reason - This is the 2nd level classification of a service request and reflects a program name or a division assigned to perform the service request.\'a0 Type - This is the 3rd level classification describing what the service request specifically is for. It is the most common designation description used in the city.\'a0 Title - Similar to the Type column, this describes more details about the incident.\'a0 Open Date Time - This is the date and time stamp when the department, program, or division assigned to complete the task in a service request starts working that service request.\'a0 Case Status - If case status = "0", it means the case is closed. If case status = "1", the case is still considered open. All cases with a case status of "1" should not have a closed date. Closed Date Time - The date a resolving department, division or program completed the service request.\'a0 XCoord & YCoord - This is the coordinate the city provides of where the service request occurred in the WGS 84 web Mercator auxilliary sphere coordinate system.

\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec3 Properties are organized by the category in which they were phased in to the benchmarking program, with important metrics from the most recent reporting year of 2015 being toggleable. By clicking on a point, a user may learn more about an individual property's characteristics, energy efficiency, and water use from prior reporting years when available. Public buildings from the City of Minneapolis, Hennepin County, the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board, and Minneapolis Public Schools were phased in first and therefore show data for 2012-2015. The largest private buildings 100,000 sqft and greater, show publicly available data starting in 2014. The remaining category, private buildings between 50,000-100,000 sqft in size, data is made publicly available starting with the 2015 dataset. The toggleable metrics highlight the most summary information of building energy and water efficiency: ENERGY STAR score - The 1-100 ENERGY STAR score was developed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and provides a metric for comparison with other similar buildings across the country. The score accounts for differences in climate, occupancy and operating hours. A score of 50 represents median energy performance, while a score of 75 or better indicates a building is a top performer. The higher the score, the more efficient the building. Energy Use Intensity (EUI) - The metric used for comparing buildings in Energy Star, EUI expresses a building\'92s energy use relative to its size. In this report it is expressed as kBtu/ft\'b2, and is calculated by taking the total energy consumed in a year (in kBtu) and dividing it by the floor area of the building (in ft\'b2). The lower the kBtu/ft\'b2, the lower the energy consumption. Weather-normalized Energy Use Intensity - Energy use is adjusted to account year-to-year weather differences, allowing for comparison of a building to itself over time. Through this procedure, the energy in a given year is adjusted to express the energy that would have been consumed under 30-year average weather conditions. Weather-normalized EUI also uses the kBtu/ft\'b2 unit.
